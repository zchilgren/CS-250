How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  I first take a look at all of the described needs for the application and then look at which of those features work together wiht one another and then begin implimenting them in groups, user stories help to realize priorities and to get a better understanding of the data needed for each feature 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approah developing programs by first creating an overall frame for the application and then by working on detailed features in smaller chuncks to better be able to both design features and making sure they function as intended with the rest of the system.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  I feel that to be a good team member you have to be strong in communication and flexible in your skills to better help to improve the project that is being worked on and furthering everyone in the group.
